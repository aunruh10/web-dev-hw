<h1> About Me </h1>
<h3> A Brief Description... </h3>
<p>
  I'm just a hot mess.
</p>

<h3> Why I chose this Project... </h3>
<p>
  When I was in ninth grade, my english teacher had decided to show us how to
  bind a few pieces of paper together to demonstrate how books are held together.
  I enjoyed the novelty of being able to craft your own book. Call me old fashioned,
  but the act of making something out of virtually nothing was deeply satisfying,
  especially when the object you craft can be useful.
</p>

<h3> Where Can You Find More? </h3>
<p>
There are several great tutorials on YouTube and all across the internet.
You can also check with your local hobby store to see if on-site lessons are possible.
