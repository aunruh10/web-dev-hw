## Divs, Classes, Ids and Spans
A <Div> defines a section in a document in the most broad sense. A <span> is similar, but can be altered with CSS or javascript. Ids are precisely that: identifiers for elements. Classes can also act this way, but like a span, it also stylizes them in the same CSS format.
## Alt Text
The term alt text is used in case something goes wrong with the display. It describes the content to the viewer without having the content present.
## The Work cycle
I was slightly confused by the divs when they first showed up. The organization explained itself, but I was fairly perplexed at the impact they had on ordering the content. I had a good amount of difficulty with linking the images, but the embedding was no trouble at all. It was strange.
