        <h3> Spade and Archer </h3>
<hr/>
<p>
Samuel Spade's jaw was long and bony, his chin a jutting <br>
v under the more flexible v of his mouth. His nostrils curved <br>
back to make another, smaller, v. His yellow-grey eyes were <br>
horizontal. The v motif was picked up again by thickish brows <br>
rising outward from twin creases above a hooked nose, <br>
and his pale brown hair grew down--from high flat temples--in <br>
a point on his forehead. He looked rather pleasantly like a blond satan. <br>
<br>
He said to Effie Ferine: "Yes, sweetheart?"<br>
<br>
She was a lanky sunburned girl whose tan dress of thin woolen <br>
stuff clung to her with an effect of dampness. Her eyes were <br>
brown and playful in a shiny boyish face. She finished shutting <br>
the door behind her, leaned against it, and said: "There's a girl <br>
wants to see you. Her name's Wonderly." <br>
<br>
"A customer?" <br>
<br>
"I guess so. You'll want to see her anyway: she's a knockout." <br>
<br>
"Shoo her in, darling," said Spade. "Shoo her in." <br>
<br>
Effie Ferine opened the door again, following it back into <br>
the outer office, standing with a hand on the knob while saying: <br>
"Will you come in, Miss Wonderly?" <br>
<br>
A voice said, "Thank you," so softly that only the purest <br>
articulation made the words intelligible, and a young woman <br>
came through the doorway. She advanced slowly, with tentative <br>
steps, looking at Spade with cobalt-blue eyes that were both <br>
shy and probing. <br>
<br>
She was tall and pliantly slender, without angularity anywhere. <br>
Her body was erect and high-breasted, her legs long, her hands  <br>
and feet narrow. She wore two shades of blue that had been selected <br>
because of her eyes. The hair curling from under her blue hat was <br>
darkly red, her full lips more brightly red. White teeth glistened <br>
in the crescent her timid smile made. <br>
<br>
Spade rose bowing and indicating with a thick-fingered hand the oaken <br>
armchair beside his desk. He was quite six feet tall. The steep rounded <br>
slope of his shoulders made his body seem almost conical --no broader <br>
than it was thick--and kept his freshly pressed grey coat from fitting <br>
very well. <br>
<br>
Miss Wonderly murmured, "Thank you," softly as before and sat down on <br>
the edge of the chair's wooden seat. <br>
<br>
Spade sank into his swivel-chair, made a quarter-turn to face her, <br>
smiled politely. He smiled without separating his lips. <br>
<br>
All the v's in his face grew longer.
