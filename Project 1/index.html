  <hr />
  <p> All my bags are packed <br />
    I'm ready to go <br />
    I'm standin' here outside your door <br />
    I hate to wake you up to say goodbye <br />
    But the dawn is breakin' <br />
    It's early morn <br />
    The taxi's waitin' <br />
    He's blowin' his horn <br />
    Already I'm so lonesome <br />
    I could die <br />
  </p>
  <br />
  <p> So kiss me and smile for me <br />
    Tell me that you'll wait for me <br />
    Hold me like you'll never let me go <br />
    'Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane <br />
    Don't know when I'll be back again <br />
    Oh babe, I hate to go <br />
  </p>
  <br />
  <p> There's so many times I've let you down <br />
    So many times I've played around <br />
    I tell you now, they don't mean a thing <br />
    Ev'ry place I go, I'll think of you <br />
    Ev'ry song I sing, I'll sing for you <br />
    When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring <br />
  </p>
  <br />
  <p> So kiss me and smile for me <br />
    Tell me that you'll wait for me <br />
    Hold me like you'll never let me go <br />
    'Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane <br />
    Don't know when I'll be back again <br />
    Oh babe, I hate to go <br />
  </p>
  <br />
  <p> Now the time has come to leave you <br />
    One more time <br />
    Let me kiss you <br />
    Then close your eyes <br />
    I'll be on my way <br />
    Dream about the days to come <br />
    When I won't have to leave alone <br />
    About the times, I won't have to say <br />
  </p>
  <br />
  <p> Oh, kiss me and smile for me <br />
    Tell me that you'll wait for me <br />
    Hold me like you'll never let me go <br />
    'Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane <br />
    Don't know when I'll be back again <br />
    Oh babe, I hate to go <br />
  </p>
  <br />
  <p> But, I'm leavin' on a jet plane <br />
      Don't know when I'll be back again <br />
      Oh babe, I hate to go <br />
    </p>
