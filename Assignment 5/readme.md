## Design Research
To be honest, I didn't do much research on the design element for the 60's era. I was more concerned with just completing a page. However, I knew that the colors had to be bold and bright and in your face, almost, which lead to my decision to use the diamond graphic in the background. It covered the page, so no matter where you looked, it was there.
## My colors
I wanted to use some neutral and pale colors in order to offset the colorful graphic, which led to the colors used being:
- White
- LightGray
- rgb(102, 176, 205)

## Work Cycle
I had a difficult time trying to get more of the layout right for the elements, rather than focus on the colorings. It was a stupid move, but I'm glad I got the help in order to figure it out.
