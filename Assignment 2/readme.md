## What is a Version Control System?
A Version Control System is like a backup system for coding. Every time you make a version of a text or code, it can be made available through backing up the file to the server. If anything goes wrong, you can then return back to the most recent version of the file that you sent. We're using this system for class for a safety net, so that we don't lose any data in the process. We're only students, after all...
## My Work Cycle
It has been an interesting semester so far... I'm just catching up to the rest of the class. I didn't have too many issues with the coding aspect of the assignment, the most difficult learning the differences of text styles in markdown.
