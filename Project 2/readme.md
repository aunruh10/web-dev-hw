## My Experience with html
In a sense, nothing was new, but nothing was old. In my experience, I had learned basic C coding for high school robotics, which shared a similar organizational structure and function with html. What seemed different were the commands used, maybe the links as well.
## CSS? Ok!
As for CSS, I have no idea what to expect. I imagine it will be fun to play around with the design element.
## Work Cycle
I didn't have too many difficulties with this one, rather the fact that they took so long to finish. Only problem I had was getting the images to link again.
