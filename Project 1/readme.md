##Browsers
I normally default to using Google Chrome on all devices, due to the connection I have with the products it provides.
A Browser relays information from a web server through the network and interprets it to place on a user interface. It does this by use of a **rendering engine**, which structures the visuals of the page, and the **browser engine**, who directs actions between the UI and the rendering engine and/or external server communications.

## The Wayback Experience

It was very interesting to see the bit depth change over time, building more complex images and structures. For some websites, a page could undergo a completely new style to accommodate the change in technology.

## My Work Cycle

It was fairly straightforward with the code, I didn't have any difficulty. However, I still have issues with embedding images. Normally because of size.
