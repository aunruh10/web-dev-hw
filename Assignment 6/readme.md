## Design Process
The fonts I chose had more to do with the aesthetic I was going for in relation to the story. The Maltese Falcon is a wonderful noir piece, so I wanted to reflect the ominous and gritty nature in the fonts. The heading font also being of a typewriter style was an added bonus.
## System/Web/Web-Safe?
A system font is a font used by the OS to display text. A web font is utilized for displaying text on the web browser. A font that is web-safe is a font that can be used for both, having it be used on the web or accessed on your computer.
## Work Cycle
This was a really fun one to do! I'm very glad that I was able to come in and get the help I needed, otherwise it probably wouldn't have turned out the way it did. The button was my greatest challenge, simply trying to link it to another page. It never occurred to wrap the <a> element around the <button> element. Also, the <div> inside a <div> trick was very valuable to learn.
