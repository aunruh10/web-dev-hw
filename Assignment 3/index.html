  <h1> Cheese Grits </h1>
  <q> Obviously as I'm getting older, I'm seeing changes in my body that I may not like... but I do love food, and I'm from the South. I'm not gonna lie, I eat fried chicken, I love macaroni and cheese, and I love grits. </q>
    <h2> Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> 2 cups whole milk </li>
      <li> 2 cups water </li>
      <li> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt </li>
      <li> 1 cup <strong> coarse </strong> ground cornmeal </li>
      <li> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
      <li> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter </li>
      <li> 4 ounces sharp Cheddar, shredded </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Directions: </h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Place the milk, water, and salt into a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. </li>
      <li> Once the milk mixture comes to a boil, gradually add the cornmeal while continually whisking. </li>
      <li> Once all of the cornmeal has been incorporated, decrease the heat to low and cover. </li>
      <li> Remove lid and whisk frequently, every 3 to 4 minutes, to prevent grits from sticking or forming lumps; make sure to get into corners of pot when whisking. </li>
      <li> Cook for 20 to 25 minutes or until mixture is creamy. </li>
      <li> Remove from the heat, add the pepper and butter, and whisk to combine. </li>
      <li> Once the butter is melted, gradually whisk in the cheese a little at a time. </li>
      <li> Serve <em> immediately. </em> </li>
